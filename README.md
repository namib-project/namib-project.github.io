# NAMIB Website
This is the NAMIB Website, created using React & Next.js

## Getting started with development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Export the website

First, build the project:

```bash
npm run export
# or
yarn export
```

Afterwards, build the static site resources: 

```bash
npm run export
# or
yarn export
```

The ``/out`` directory will contain all static files. They can be served on any HTTP-Webserver.

For development or testing purposes, you can serve the directory locally:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```
