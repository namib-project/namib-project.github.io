## Towards a more secure and interoperable Internet of Things

NAMIB is an undergraduate computer science project at the University of Bremen that deals with self-description standards of IoT devices. 
By providing implementations for the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), the Semantic Definition Format (SDF), and the Web of Things Thing Description (WoT TD) NAMIB contributes to making IoT devices more secure and interoperable.
